# Maze Solver Using BFS with Tkinter GUI 🧩

This is a simple Python application that visualizes the solution of a maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. It uses the **Tkinter** library to create an interactive GUI where users can set the start and end points and solve the maze visually.

## 🖼️ Features

- Graphical User Interface built with `Tkinter`.
- Click to set:
  - ✅ Start point (Left-click)
  - 🛑 End point (Right-click)
- Press **Solve Maze** to visualize the BFS path in real time.
- Clear color-coded maze grid:
  - White = Walkable path
  - Black = Wall
  - Green = Start point
  - Red = End point
  - Blue = Path found by BFS

## 🚀 Getting Started
